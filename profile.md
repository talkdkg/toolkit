# Development Profile

As an application developer, I have over a decade of experience with many different clients/companies with varying projects using many different technologies. I've taken projects from concept to development to deployment; from the backend to the frontend. Here are some current highlights of my open sourced work.

## Journ

> Journ is a Node package program based on my style of journaling, where I like to store notes in markdown format. With each day in its own file and stored as text files, I could easy search and view them from my command line and easily back them up to GitHub for archiving. With Journ, I rebuilt the bash scripts I used to organize my files to a Javascript Node package to share in open source.
